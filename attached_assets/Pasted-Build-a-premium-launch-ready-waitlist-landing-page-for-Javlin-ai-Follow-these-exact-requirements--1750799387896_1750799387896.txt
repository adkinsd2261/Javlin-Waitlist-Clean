Build a premium, launch-ready waitlist landing page for Javlin.ai. Follow these exact requirements:

Background: Use a deep, dark gradient (#181B2B to #232342 or similar), not a solid black or white. The entire page must have this gradient.

Accent: Use electric blue (#5151FF) for main buttons, focus rings, and highlights.

Text: White or light gray. Font: Inter (400/500/600). Headline and body text should be large and easy to read.

Layout: Wide spacing, minimal, no clutter. Everything is centered and calm (Notion/Apple style).

Sections (in order):

Hero

Headline: “Javlin: The AI Co-founder for Next-Gen Founders”

Subheadline: “The first platform that remembers your best solutions, warns you about past mistakes, and grows smarter with every project.”

Large, rounded CTA button: “Join the Waitlist” (electric blue, glowing soft shadow)

Features/Benefits

4 spaced cards/rows, each with an icon and short headline+description:
