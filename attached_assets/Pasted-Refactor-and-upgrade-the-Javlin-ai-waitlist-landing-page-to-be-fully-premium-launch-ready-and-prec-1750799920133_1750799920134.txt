Refactor and upgrade the Javlin.ai waitlist landing page to be fully premium, launch-ready, and precisely on-brand. Follow these step-by-step fixes:

1. Background & Layout
Change the main background to a deep, dark gradient:
Use bg-gradient-to-br from-[#181B2B] to-[#232342] on the root <div>, replacing any solid or slate backgrounds.

Ensure all text is white or very light gray. Font should be Inter, weights 400/500/600.

Every section (hero, features, form, founders badge, footer) should be generously spaced (py-16 or py-24) and centered. Remove any unnecessary borders or boxes.

2. Hero Section
Headline:
Javlin: The AI Co-founder for Next-Gen Founders

Subheadline:
The first platform that remembers your best solutions, warns you about past mistakes, and grows smarter with every project.

Main CTA button:

Use electric blue (bg-[#5151FF] hover:bg-[#6a5cff]), soft shadow (shadow-lg), large, and rounded (rounded-2xl text-lg font-semibold px-8 py-4).

Button text: “Join the Waitlist”

3. Features Section
Add a 4-card/row feature section (centered, spaced out), each with a minimal icon, bold headline, and 1-sentence description:

MemoryOS:
Proactive, intelligent memory brain for your work.

Cross-Project Intelligence:
Learns from all your projects, not just one.

Personal Co-founder:
Context-aware, adaptive support—beyond chatbots.

Control & Privacy:
Your data, always yours—export/edit anytime.

4. Waitlist Form
Update the form fields:

Name (required)

Email (required)

“What would you want your AI cofounder to remember for you?” (optional textarea)

Inputs: Wide, softly rounded (rounded-xl), blue focus ring (focus:ring-[#5151FF]), clear label above each.

On submit, display a thank-you message or success state. No backend needed for now.

5. Founders Badge / Early Adopter Callout
Below the form, add a distinct, visually-prominent card or banner:

Text:
Founders’ Special: First 1,000 signups get 30% off Pro or Premium for life and an exclusive Founders badge.

Use the electric blue accent or a glowing effect to make it stand out.

6. Footer / Privacy Statement
At the very bottom, add:
“Your data is safe, always exportable. No spam. Privacy-first.”

Style it small, centered, subtle (not distracting).

7. Polish & Responsive
Review the site on mobile and desktop.

All spacing, buttons, text, and inputs should scale and remain easy to read/use.

Do not use any white/light backgrounds—keep the dark gradient for the whole page.

Reference: Use copy, content, and tone from the “Javlin.ai Webmap v1.4” masterdoc. Prioritize clarity and calm, not flashy or generic SaaS design.

Deliverable:
A single React+Tailwind page (Waitlist.jsx or equivalent) matching all the above. Clearly comment or label each section in the code for easy review.
